# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
This capstone focuses on predicting whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX offers launches at a much lower cost than competitors because it can reuse the first stage. By predicting landing success, launch costs can be estimated, helping rival companies make competitive bids against SpaceX.
